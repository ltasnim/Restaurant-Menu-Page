# Restaurant-Menu-Page

The project is a prototype restaurant menu page developed in HTML and CSS. The layout displays two sections (breakfast/coffee, lunch/dinner) at varying price points. The program also incorporates the CSS Flexbox Layout, Bootstrap, and Chrome Developer Tools to make the website compatible with all dimensions.
